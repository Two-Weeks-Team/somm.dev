description: 'Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA).

  Identifies potential failure modes in advance and analyzes their impact and countermeasures.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Failure Analysis (FMEA)


  Analyze if the project considered potential failure modes.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Failure Mode Identification**: Identified how it could fail?

  2. **Impact Analysis**: Evaluated the impact of each failure?

  3. **Occurrence Probability**: Considered probability of failure?

  4. **Countermeasures**: Are there countermeasures for each failure?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Systematic FMEA performed, prioritized countermeasures exist

  - 4 points: Key failure modes identified and addressed

  - 3 points: Some risks recognized

  - 2 points: Superficial risk mention

  - 1 point: No risk analysis
