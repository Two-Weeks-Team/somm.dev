promptTemplate: '## Assumption Reversal Analysis


  Analyze if the project discovered and challenged hidden assumptions.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Assumption Discovery**: Have hidden assumptions of the project been identified?

  2. **Assumption Explication**: Have implicit assumptions been expressed explicitly?

  3. **Assumption Verification**: Has the validity of each assumption been reviewed?

  4. **Assumption Challenge**: Did reversing assumptions yield new perspectives?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Discovered core assumptions and gained new insights by reversing them

  - 4 points: Identified and verified key assumptions

  - 3 points: Recognized some assumptions

  - 2 points: Barely conscious of assumptions

  - 1 point: No consideration of assumptions
