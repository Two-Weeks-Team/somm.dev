description: 'Technique to systematically identify and categorize all constraints faced by the project.

  Constraints are often sources of innovation.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Constraint Mapping Analysis


  Analyze if the project clearly grasped constraint conditions.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Technical Constraints**: Are technical limitations recognized?

  2. **Business Constraints**: Are time, cost, and resource constraints considered?

  3. **User Constraints**: Are user environment constraints identified?

  4. **Regulatory Constraints**: Are legal and regulatory constraints considered?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Systematically identified constraints in all 4 areas (Tech/Biz/User/Reg)

  - 4 points: Identified constraints in 3 areas

  - 3 points: Identified constraints in 2 areas

  - 2 points: Recognized constraints in only 1 area

  - 1 points: No constraint analysis
