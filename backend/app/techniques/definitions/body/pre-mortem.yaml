  Analyze if the project performed a Pre-mortem analysis.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Failure Assumption**: Did they assume "The project failed"?

  2. **Cause Backtracking**: Did they trace back the causes of failure?

  3. **Early Warning**: Did they identify signals that could be signs of failure?

  4. **Prevention Strategy**: Are there preventive measures for identified risks?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Complete pre-mortem, early warning system, prevention strategy

  - 4 points: Analysis of key failure causes and response

  - 3 points: Considered some failure possibilities

  - 2 points: Brief mention of risks

  - 1 point: No pre-mortem
