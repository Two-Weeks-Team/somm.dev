description: 'Technique to discover potential problems by asking "How could this fail?".

  Identifies risks in advance through negative scenarios.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Reverse Brainstorming Analysis


  Analyze if the project identified risks through reverse thinking.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Failure Scenarios**: Did they consider "How could it fail?"?

  2. **Reverse Thinking**: Did they think about the problem in reverse?

  3. **Risk Discovery**: Did they derive risk factors from reverse thinking?

  4. **Preventive Measures**: Are there countermeasures for discovered risks?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Systematic reverse thinking, various failure scenarios, preventive measures

  - 4 points: Key failure possibilities identified and addressed

  - 3 points: Some negative scenarios considered

  - 2 points: Superficial risk mention

  - 1 points: No reverse thinking
