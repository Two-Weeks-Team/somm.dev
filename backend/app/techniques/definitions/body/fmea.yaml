description: 'Risk analysis technique developed by US Military (1949) and validated in NASA Apollo program.

  ISO/IEC 60812 standard. Identifies potential Failure Modes and calculates Risk Priority Number (RPN) by evaluating Severity, Occurrence, and Detection.

  '
promptTemplate: '## FMEA Analysis


  Evaluate if the project analyzed potential failures from an FMEA perspective.


  ### FMEA Core Elements:

  1. **Failure Mode ID**: Enumerated possible ways of failure?

  2. **Impact Analysis**: Impact of each failure on the system?

  3. **Severity (S)**: Severity of damage if failure occurs (1-10)

  4. **Occurrence (O)**: Probability of failure occurrence (1-10)

  5. **Detection (D)**: Ability to detect failure beforehand (1-10)

  6. **RPN Calculation**: Risk priority calculated as S × O × D


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Complete FMEA, RPN calculation, improvement actions established

  - 4 points: Key failure modes analyzed, countermeasures prepared

  - 3 points: Some failure modes identified and impact analyzed

  - 2 points: Brief mention of risk factors

  - 1 points: No failure analysis
