description: 'Technique to test system survivability and resilience by imagining extreme disaster scenarios.

  Pursues design that works even in extreme situations.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Zombie Apocalypse Scenario Analysis


  Analyze if the project considered survival in extreme scenarios.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Extreme Scenarios**: Did they imagine worst-case scenarios?

  2. **Core Functions**: What are the core things to maintain in extreme situations?

  3. **Survival Mode**: Is there a mode that works with minimal resources?

  4. **Recovery Plan**: Is there a post-disaster recovery plan?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Extreme scenario analysis, survival mode, recovery plan exist

  - 4 points: Prepared for major extreme situations

  - 3 points: Some extreme situations considered

  - 2 points: Only normal situations considered

  - 1 point: Extreme scenarios ignored
