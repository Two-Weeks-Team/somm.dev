description: 'Technique to design the "worst solution" first and then reverse it to derive a good solution.

  Clarifies what should be avoided.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Anti-Solution Design Analysis


  Analyze if the project utilized anti-solution thinking.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Worst Design**: Did they imagine the "worst solution"?

  2. **What to Avoid**: Did they clarify what to avoid?

  3. **Reverse Utilization**: Did they derive the best from the worst?

  4. **Defining Boundaries**: Did they set boundaries for what not to do?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Derived best solution by reversing anti-solution design

  - 4 points: Clearly defined what to avoid

  - 3 points: Recognized some anti-patterns

  - 2 points: Mentioned negative examples only

  - 1 point: No anti-solution thinking
