description: 'A technique to assess long-term viability by analyzing evolutionary pressures from the market and environment.

  Examines adaptability and ability to respond to change.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Evolutionary Pressure Analysis


  Analyze if the project has adaptability to environmental changes.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Environmental Change**: Have trends in market/technology changes been identified?

  2. **Adaptation Strategy**: Is there a strategy to respond to changes?

  3. **Flexibility**: Is the structure capable of pivoting or adjusting?

  4. **Long-term Survival**: Has long-term viability been considered?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Trend prediction, flexible adaptation strategy, long-term vision

  - 4 points: Environmental change recognition and response plan

  - 3 points: Some change factors considered

  - 2 points: Focused only on current situation

  - 1 point: Environmental changes ignored
