description: 'A technique to analyze available resources (time, budget, manpower, technology) and evaluate feasibility within constraints.

  Forms the basis for realistic planning.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Resource Constraints Analysis


  Analyze if the project has realistically considered resource constraints.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Time Resources**: Is the development timeline estimated realistically?

  2. **Human Resources**: Are team capabilities and scale considered?

  3. **Technical Resources**: Are technical capabilities and tools identified?

  4. **Budget Resources**: Are costs considered realistically?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Detailed analysis of all resource constraints and realistic planning

  - 4 points: Key resource constraints identified and addressed

  - 3 points: Some constraints recognized

  - 2 points: Resource constraints underestimated

  - 1 points: Resource constraints ignored
