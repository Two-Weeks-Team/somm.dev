promptTemplate: '## Trait Transfer Analysis


  Analyze if the project has effectively transferred proven traits.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Source Identification**: From which success cases were traits taken?

  2. **Trait Extraction**: What key traits were extracted?

  3. **Applicability Verification**: Was applicability in the new context reviewed?

  4. **Transfer Success**: Was the trait transfer effective?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Key traits extracted from diverse sources and creatively applied

  - 4 points: Clear trait transfer and contextualization

  - 3 points: Some traits referenced

  - 2 points: Superficial benchmarking

  - 1 points: No trait transfer
