description: 'A technique to test resilience and stability by intentionally injecting failures into the system.

  Methodology for validating system reliability developed by Netflix.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Chaos Engineering Analysis


  Analyze how the project has considered system resilience.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Failure Scenarios**: Have potential failure situations been identified?

  2. **Recovery Strategies**: Are there recovery plans for each failure?

  3. **Testing Plan**: Is there a plan to test failure responses?

  4. **Monitoring**: Is there a way to monitor system health?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Systematic failure scenarios, recovery strategies, and test plans established

  - 4 points: Major failure response plans exist

  - 3 points: Some failure situations considered

  - 2 points: Failure response unclear

  - 1 point: No consideration of failure/recovery
