description: 'A technique to visualize decision points and branches.

  Systematically analyzes the consequences and impacts of each option to find the optimal decision path.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Decision Tree Mapping Analysis


  Evaluate if the project has systematically analyzed the decision-making process.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Decision Points**: Have key decision points been identified?

  2. **Alternative Analysis**: Have alternatives for each decision been analyzed?

  3. **Outcome Prediction**: Have the consequences of each choice been predicted?

  4. **Optimal Path**: Has the best decision path been derived?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Systematic decision tree with quantitative analysis

  - 4 points: Analysis of key decision points and alternatives

  - 3 points: Some decision analysis

  - 2 points: Decision process unclear

  - 1 point: No decision analysis
