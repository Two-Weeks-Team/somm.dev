description: 'Technology maturity assessment system developed by NASA (1974) and standardized as ISO 16290:2013.

  Objectively evaluates technology development stage and readiness from TRL 1 (Basic Principle) to TRL 9 (Flight Proven).

  '
promptTemplate: '## Technology Readiness Level Analysis


  Evaluate which TRL stage the project''s core technology is at.


  ### TRL 9 Stages:

  - **TRL 1**: Basic principles observed and reported

  - **TRL 2**: Technology concept and/or application formulated

  - **TRL 3**: Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof of concept

  - **TRL 4**: Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment

  - **TRL 5**: Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment

  - **TRL 6**: System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in a relevant environment

  - **TRL 7**: System prototype demonstration in an operational environment

  - **TRL 8**: Actual system completed and qualified through test and demonstration

  - **TRL 9**: Actual system proven through successful mission operations


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: TRL 7-9, Prototype to Operational stage

  - 4 points: TRL 5-6, Validation in relevant environment

  - 3 points: TRL 3-4, Lab level validation

  - 2 points: TRL 2, Concept level

  - 1 points: TRL 1 or Unable to evaluate
