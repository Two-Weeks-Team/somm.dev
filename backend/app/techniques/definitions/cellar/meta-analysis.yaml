  Looks at the big picture beyond individual analyses.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Meta-analysis


  Analyze if the project derived meta-insights by synthesizing various analyses.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Multiple Analyses**: Was it analyzed from multiple perspectives?

  2. **Pattern Discovery**: Were common patterns found in analyses?

  3. **Conflict Resolution**: How were conflicting findings handled?

  4. **Comprehensive Insight**: Were higher-level insights derived?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Multiple analyses synthesized, high-level patterns found, integrated insight

  - 4 points: Analysis results synthesized and patterns derived

  - 3 points: Some analyses synthesized

  - 2 points: Individual analyses listed

  - 1 points: No synthesis
