promptTemplate: '## Synthesis Framework Analysis


  Analyze if the project effectively synthesized various elements.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Element Collection**: Were various inputs/opinions collected?

  2. **Integration Framework**: Is there a structure for integration?

  3. **Balance Point**: Was a balance point found for conflicting elements?

  4. **Synthesized Conclusion**: Is there an integrated conclusion/direction?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Systematic synthesis framework, clear integrated conclusion

  - 4 points: Effective element integration

  - 3 points: Some elements synthesized

  - 2 points: Elements listed only

  - 1 point: No synthesis
