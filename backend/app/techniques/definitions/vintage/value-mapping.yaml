  Analyze how well the project''s value proposition fits customer needs.


  ### Customer Profile Analysis:

  1. **Customer Jobs**: What tasks are customers trying to solve?

  2. **Pains**: What are the customer''s discomforts and obstacles?

  3. **Gains**: What results and benefits do customers want?
