description: 'Goal management system developed by Andy Grove (Intel, 1970s) and introduced to Google by John Doerr.

  Clearly defines organizational direction and measurable performance indicators by connecting Objectives and Key Results.

promptTemplate: '## OKR Analysis


  Evaluate if this project defined goals and performance using the OKR framework.


  ### OKR Core Principles:

  1. **Objective**: Is it an inspiring qualitative goal?

  2. **Key Results**: Are they measurable quantitative indicators?

  3. **Challenging Goal**: Is it a stretch goal achievable at 70%?

  4. **Alignment**: Do team/individual OKRs connect to higher goals?

  5. **Transparency**: Are OKRs public and trackable?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Clear OKR system, measurable, fully aligned

  - 4 points: O+KR defined, mostly measurable

  - 3 points: Clear objective but vague KRs

  - 2 points: Only general goals exist

  - 1 point: No goal definition
