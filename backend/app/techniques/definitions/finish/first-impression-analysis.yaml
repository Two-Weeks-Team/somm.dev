  Evaluate the first impression of this project intuitively.

  Focus on emotional/intuitive reactions rather than logical analysis.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Visual First Impression**: What is the feeling at first sight?

  2. **Emotional Reaction**: What emotions arise (interest, curiosity, trust, anxiety)?

  3. **Memorability**: What remains in memory first?

  4. **Intuitive Understanding**: Is it understood without explanation?

  5. **Desire to Use**: Do you feel like using it?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 4 points: Positive first impression, interesting

  - 3 points: Neutral first impression, no special emotion

  - 2 points: Somewhat negative, complex or confusing
