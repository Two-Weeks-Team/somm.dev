  '
promptTemplate: '## Gut Check


  Evaluate this project with pure intuition without logical analysis.

  Focus on "how it feels" rather than "why".


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Instinctive Reaction**: "This will work" vs "Something is wrong" at first sight?

  2. **Trust**: Can you trust this team/project?

  3. **Authenticity**: Does it feel like they genuinely want to solve the problem?

  4. **Polish**: Does it feel rough or polished?

  5. **Success Prediction**: Does it feel like it will succeed?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Strong positive gut feeling "This will definitely work"

  - 4 points: Positive feeling "Looks good"

  - 3 points: No special feeling, neutral

  - 2 points: Anxious feeling "Something is missing"

  - 1 point: Negative gut feeling "This won''t work"
