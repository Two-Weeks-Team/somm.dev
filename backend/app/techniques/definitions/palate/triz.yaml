promptTemplate: '## TRIZ Analysis


  Analyze how much this project utilized TRIZ principles.


  ### TRIZ Core Concepts:

  1. **Identify Contradiction**: Did it recognize technical/physical contradictions?

  2. **40 Inventive Principles**: Applied principles like segmentation, extraction, local quality?

  3. **Ideal Final Result**: Did it define the ideal solution?

  4. **Resource Utilization**: Did it creatively use existing resources?

  5. **Technical Evolution**: Did it consider technology evolution patterns?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Resolved contradictions, applied multiple principles, achieved ideal result

  - 4 points: Clear contradiction recognition, applied 2-3 principles

  - 3 points: Recognized some contradictions, applied 1 principle

  - 2 points: Implicit contradiction resolution attempt

  - 1 points: TRIZ concepts not applied
