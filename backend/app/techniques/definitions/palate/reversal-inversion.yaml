description: 'Technique to look at a problem or situation in reverse.

  Discovers new perspectives and solutions by asking "What if we do the opposite?".

  '
promptTemplate: '## Reversal Inversion Analysis


  Analyze traces of viewing the problem in reverse in this project.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Perspective Reversal**: Is there evidence of approaching the problem from the opposite direction?

  2. **Applying Reverse Thinking**: Are there traces of asking "What if we do the opposite?"?

  3. **Counter-intuitive Solution**: Is there an approach different from general common sense?

  4. **New Insights**: What new insights were discovered through reversal?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Breakthrough discovery through complete reversal of the problem

  - 4 points: Attempted reversal of key assumptions and suggested new solutions

  - 3 points: Partial perspective shift

  - 2 points: Maintained traditional approach

  - 1 point: No trace of reverse thinking
