promptTemplate: '## SCAMPER Analysis


  Analyze how innovative this project is from the 7 SCAMPER perspectives.


  ### SCAMPER 7 Perspectives:

  1. **S (Substitute)**: Did it substitute existing elements with others?

  2. **C (Combine)**: Did it combine existing functions/ideas anew?

  3. **A (Adapt)**: Did it apply solutions from other fields?

  4. **M (Modify)**: Did it meaningfully change size, shape, or attributes?

  5. **P (Put to other uses)**: Did it use existing things for new purposes?

  6. **E (Eliminate)**: Did it eliminate unnecessary elements to simplify?

  7. **R (Reverse/Rearrange)**: Did it reverse order or perspective to create new value?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: 5+ SCAMPER elements clearly applied

  - 4 points: 3-4 SCAMPER elements applied

  - 3 points: 2 SCAMPER elements applied

  - 2 points: 1 SCAMPER element partially applied

  - 1 points: No SCAMPER elements applied (Existing method as is)
