description: 'Concept Blending Theory by Fauconnier & Turner.

  Fuses concepts from different domains to generate new emergent meanings.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Concept Blending Analysis


  Analyze if there is creative fusion of different concepts in this project.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Input Space Identification**: What domains/concepts were combined?

  2. **Generic Space**: What is the common abstract structure of the combined concepts?

  3. **Blended Space**: Has an emergent structure been created?

  4. **New Meaning**: Has a new meaning not present in the input spaces emerged?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Creates a completely new category like "Land yacht"

  - 4 points: Clear emergent fusion of 2+ domains

  - 3 points: Meaningful combination between related fields

  - 2 points: Combination of functions within the same field

  - 1 points: Single concept applied, no blending
