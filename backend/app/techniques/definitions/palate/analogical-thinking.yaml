description: 'Thinking method to find patterns in similar situations or problems and apply them to the current problem.

  Gains new insights in the form of ''X is like Y''.

promptTemplate: '## Analogical Thinking Analysis


  Analyze traces of analogical thinking in this project.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Analogy Discovery**: Did it reference similar problems/solutions in other domains?

  2. **Pattern Extraction**: Did it extract common patterns from similar cases?

  3. **Application Quality**: Was the analogy appropriately applied to the current problem?

  4. **Insight Depth**: Is the insight gained through analogy deep?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Core solution derived from deep structural analogy

  - 4 points: New approach discovered through effective analogy

  - 3 points: Uses analogy but at a surface level

  - 2 points: Only superficial comparison exists

  - 1 points: No trace of analogical thinking
