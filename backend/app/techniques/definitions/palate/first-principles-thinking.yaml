description: 'Thinking technique to fundamentally disassemble existing assumptions and practices and rebuild from basic principles.

  Famous for being used by Elon Musk at SpaceX and Tesla.

  '
promptTemplate: '## First Principles Thinking Analysis


  Analyze how this project challenged and rebuilt existing assumptions.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Identify Existing Assumptions**: What are the assumptions taken for granted in this domain?

  2. **Evidence of Challenge**: Is there evidence the team explicitly challenged these assumptions?

  3. **Decomposition to Basics**: Are there traces of breaking the problem down to basic components?

  4. **Reconstruction Method**: Which parts were newly built from basic principles?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Redefined industry paradigm (e.g., "Recalculated battery pack price based on raw materials")

  - 4 points: Challenged 2+ key assumptions and suggested alternatives

  - 3 points: Challenged 1 key assumption

  - 2 points: Minor variation to existing approach

  - 1 points: Copied existing solutions as is
