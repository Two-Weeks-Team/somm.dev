  Utilizes the wisdom of 3.8 billion years of evolution.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Biomimicry Analysis


  Analyze if the project was inspired by nature.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Nature Mimicry**: Did it mimic nature''s designs or processes?

  2. **Biological Inspiration**: Did it get ideas from biological characteristics?

  3. **Ecosystem Principles**: Did it apply ecosystem principles (circulation, adaptation, etc.)?

  4. **Sustainability**: Did it reference nature''s sustainable methods?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Principles of nature deeply applied to core solution

  - 4 points: Clear biomimicry elements reflected in design

  - 3 points: Partially inspired by nature

  - 2 points: Nature reference is superficial

  - 1 point: No biomimicry elements
