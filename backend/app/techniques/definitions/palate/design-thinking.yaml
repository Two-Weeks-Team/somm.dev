  Creative approach solving problems in 5 steps: Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Design Thinking Analysis


  Analyze how well this project applied the 5 steps of Design Thinking.


  ### Design Thinking 5 Steps:

  1. **Empathize**: Did it deeply understand user needs and pain points?

  2. **Define**: Did it define the problem in a clear and actionable form?

  3. **Ideate**: Did it brainstorm various solutions creatively?

  4. **Prototype**: Did it make a prototype for quick experimentation?

  5. **Test**: Did it receive feedback from actual users?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Clearly performed all 5 steps, applied iterative improvement cycle

  - 4 points: Performed 4+ steps, reflected user feedback

  - 3 points: Performed 3 steps, basic user understanding

  - 2 points: Partially performed 1-2 steps

  - 1 points: No application of Design Thinking
