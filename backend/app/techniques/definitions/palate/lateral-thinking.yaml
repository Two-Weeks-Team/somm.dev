  Approaches from the side instead of logical/vertical thinking to discover new patterns and perspectives.

  '
promptTemplate: '## Lateral Thinking Analysis


  Analyze traces of approaching the problem from the side in this project.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Breaking Patterns**: Is there an approach that deviates from existing thinking patterns?

  2. **Alternative Perspectives**: Are there traces of viewing the problem from a completely different angle?

  3. **Creative Jump**: Is there a creative leap skipping logical steps?

  4. **New Patterns**: Did it create new patterns that didn''t exist before?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Created completely new patterns and approaches

  - 4 points: Discovered new solutions with clear lateral approach

  - 3 points: Partially applied lateral thinking

  - 2 points: Mostly logical/vertical approach

  - 1 points: Used only traditional sequential thinking
