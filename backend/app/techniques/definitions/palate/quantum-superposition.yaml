description: 'Creative thinking technique inspired by the superposition principle of quantum mechanics.

  Maintains conflicting possibilities simultaneously to search for the optimal solution.

  Considers "Both This and That" instead of "Either This or That".

  '
promptTemplate: '## Quantum Superposition Thinking Analysis


  Analyze how this project handles conflicting possibilities.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Escaping Dichotomy**: Did it choose "Both" instead of "Either/Or"?

  2. **Integrating Contradictions**: How were conflicting requirements resolved?

  3. **Multiple Paths**: Were multiple possibilities kept open?

  4. **Flexibility**: Is the structure adaptable to situations?

  5. **Utilizing Paradox**: Was a paradoxical situation used as an opportunity?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Simultaneously maintains multiple possibilities with flexible response

  - 4 points: Considers multiple possibilities in some areas

  - 3 points: Reviews 2-3 alternatives

  - 2 points: Focuses on a single path, limited alternatives

  - 1 points: Dichotomous thinking, no flexibility
