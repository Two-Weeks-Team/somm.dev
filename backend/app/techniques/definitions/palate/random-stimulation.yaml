  '
promptTemplate: '## Random Stimulation Analysis


  Analyze if there are unexpected connections or non-linear ideas in this project.


  ### Analysis Perspectives:

  1. **Unexpected Connections**: Are there combinations of elements that are not logically connected?

  2. **Non-linear Thinking**: Are there leap ideas that are not incremental?

  3. **Creative Combination**: Did it connect things that are not generally connected?

  4. **Serendipity**: Are there traces of accidental discovery or inspiration?


  ### Scoring Criteria:

  - 5 points: Innovative ideas created through very unexpected connections

  - 4 points: Non-linear idea connections are clear

  - 3 points: Contains some unexpected elements

  - 2 points: Mostly logical and predictable connections

  - 1 point: All connections are obvious and linear
